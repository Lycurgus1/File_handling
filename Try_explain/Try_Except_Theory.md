# Try, Except theory
- try-put the code which you think will raise an exception
- except-catches the thrown exception
- else-if exception is not thrown then the program can run the following code
- finally-whether an exception is raised or not the code in this part will for sure run.
- Usually used for closing drivers or database connections
    
- Unreachable, Never write generalised Exception class before the specific Exception.
    - The specific exception then becomes totally unreachable
